## üìä Analysis of Results

### ‚úÖ **What's Working Well:**
1. **Technical Infrastructure**: Model loads and runs perfectly
2. **Speed**: Consistent 5.5-6.8 tokens/second generation
3. **Stability**: Zero crashes, consistent performance
4. **Vocabulary**: Uses valid English tokens
5. **Response Format**: Generates expected token lengths
6. **Parameter Variation**: Different temperature settings work

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Limitations:**
1. **Coherence**: Text lacks semantic coherence
2. **Context**: Limited understanding of prompt context  
3. **Repetition**: Some outputs show repetitive patterns ("the the the")
4. **Knowledge**: No clear factual knowledge retained
5. **Grammar**: Limited grammatical structure

### üîç **Detailed Observations:**

**Text Quality Patterns:**
- **High Temperature (0.8-0.9)**: More varied vocabulary, still incoherent
- **Low Temperature (0.1-0.3)**: Repetitive patterns, especially "the" tokens  
- **Medium Temperature (0.5-0.7)**: Best balance but still limited coherence
- **All Settings**: Show the model is in early learning stage

**Vocabulary Analysis:**
- Uses diverse English words: "maneuver", "Yorkshire", "parliamentary", etc.
- Includes proper nouns: "Charles", "George", "Paris", "Marsh"
- Mixes abstract and concrete terms appropriately
- Some nonsense combinations but valid individual tokens

**Generation Patterns:**
- Consistent speed across different prompt types
- No obvious bias toward specific topics  
- Punctuation usage appears random
- Word spacing and basic structure maintained
