# WikiText-2 Dataset

The WikiText-2 dataset is a popular benchmark for language modeling, sourced from high-quality, verified "Good" and "Featured" articles on Wikipedia. The text is preserved in a mostly raw format, which includes structural elements like section headers (e.g., ` = = Section Name = = `), making it a valuable resource for training models that can understand semi-structured text.

The dataset is divided into three splits:

*   **`train`**: The largest portion of the data, used for training the language model.
*   **`validation`**: A smaller, separate set used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
*   **`test`**: A final, held-out set used to evaluate the model's performance after training is complete.

## Examples

Here are some examples to illustrate the structure and content of the data in each split:

### **Train Split Example:**

This is a typical entry from the training set. Notice the title formatting.

```
 = Valkyria Chronicles = 

 Valkyria Chronicles is a tactical role @-@ playing game developed and published by Sega , exclusively for the PlayStation 3 . The game was released in Japan on April 24 , 2008 , in North America on November 4 , 2008 , and in Europe and Australia on October 31 , 2008 . A Microsoft Windows version was released on November 11 , 2014 . A remastered version for PlayStation 4 was released in Japan on February 10 , 2016 and later in North America and Europe in May 2016 .
```

### **Validation Split Example:**

This is an example from the validation set, used to tune the model during training.

```
 = = Plot = = 

 The game is set in a fictional 1935 , on a continent reminiscent of Europe called Europa . The neutral nation of Gallia , a constitutional monarchy , is caught in a war between the East Europan Imperial Alliance and the Atlantic Federation over the precious mineral Ragnite . The Imperial army , led by Prince Maximillian , successfully invades Gallia and is in the process of taking over the country . Welkin Gunther , son of the late General Belgen Gunther , is forced to fight for his life alongside Alicia Melchiott , captain of the Bruhl town watch .
```

### **Test Split Example:**

This is an example from the test set, used for the final evaluation of the model's performance.

```
 = = Reception = = 

 Valkyria Chronicles received generally positive reviews from critics , with an average of 86 / 100 on Metacritic . The game was praised for its innovative gameplay , cel @-@ shaded art style , and story . It was awarded " Best RPG of 2008 " by GameSpot and " Strategy Game of the Year " by GameSpy . However , the game was a commercial failure in North America , selling only 33,000 copies in its first month .

# How it works

Unlike datasets like image datasets (image + label), which referring to **supervised learning** where each input has a label target. In contrast, **WikiText‚Äë2** is used in **unsupervised (or self‚Äësupervised) learning** for **language modeling**, and here‚Äôs how it works:

---

## üß† How WikiText‚Äë2 is used to train language models

### 1. **Language Modeling Objective**

Models are trained to **predict the next word** in a sequence:

```
P(w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, ..., w‚Çô) = P(w‚ÇÅ) ¬∑ P(w‚ÇÇ | w‚ÇÅ) ¬∑ ... ¬∑ P(w‚Çô | w‚ÇÅ...w‚Çô‚Çã‚ÇÅ)
```

During training, each sequence of tokens from the dataset provides supervision in the form of the next-token prediction task. This is unlike classification which maps to fixed labels. ([Hugging Face][1])

### 2. **Data preparation**

* Text is tokenized (word-level or character-level).
* Numeric token IDs are created via a vocabulary (unknown tokens `<unk>` for out-of-vocabulary).
* Sequences are grouped and often **batchified** into fixed-length segments for training, e.g. using backpropagation through time (BPTT) style batching in RNNs or fixed windows in Transformers. ([Paperspace by DigitalOcean Blog][2])

### 3. **Model architectures**

Typical models trained on WikiText‚Äë2 include:

* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTM, GRU variants‚Äîtrained to predict next tokens step by step.
* Transformer-based models (e.g. Transformer-XL, GPT-like), using masked or causal attention to condition on prior context. ([arXiv][3], [NLP-progress][4])

### 4. **Training procedure**

* Each token is the ‚Äúlabel‚Äù for the next token prediction.
* The model output is a probability distribution over vocabulary; training uses a loss such as cross-entropy comparing predicted vs. actual next token.
* Validation and test splits are used to compute metrics such as **perplexity**, a standard evaluation of how well a model predicts unseen text. ([nvidia.github.io][5])

---

## üìç Why this works despite lacking external labels

* The **text itself serves as supervision**: the model learns from the structure and flow of language, using earlier words to predict later ones.
* Even though no external classification label exists, the sequential nature of text ensures every word provides a training target.
* This approach scales easily: the entire \~2 million tokens in the train split of WikiText‚Äë2 become thousands of (input ‚Üí next token) supervised examples.

---

## Example with PyTorch (torchtext)

A typical pipeline using `torchtext.datasets.WikiText2`:

1. **Load splits** (train/valid/test) via iterators.
2. **Tokenize** and build a vocabulary.
3. **Convert** text into integer sequences and **batchify** them into fixed-sized training tensors.
4. **Feed** batches into your language model (e.g. LSTM or Transformer).
5. **Compute loss** by comparing model-predicted next-token against the actual next token in each position.
6. **Optimize** via gradient descent, evaluate on validation/test using perplexity. ([Reddit][6], [Paperspace by DigitalOcean Blog][2], [arXiv][7])

## üßæ In summary

* WikiText‚Äë2 is not paired with explicit labels like image datasets.
* Instead, it uses **self-supervision**: given a sequence of tokens, the next token is the target.
* Models learn statistical patterns, grammar, semantics, and long-range dependencies in this way.
* Performance is measured via metrics like **perplexity**‚Äîhow well a model predicts unseen text.
