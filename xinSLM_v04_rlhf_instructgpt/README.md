# SLM v04: RLHF Implementation (InstructGPT-style)

Implementation of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) following the InstructGPT methodology by Ouyang et al., 2022.

## Overview

This implementation follows the three-step RLHF process:

1. **Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT)**: Train on human demonstrations
2. **Reward Model Training**: Learn human preferences from comparisons
3. **PPO Optimization**: Use reinforcement learning to optimize policy

## Key Features

- **Reward Model**: Bradley-Terry preference learning
- **PPO Implementation**: Proximal Policy Optimization for stable training
- **KL Divergence Control**: Prevent model drift from original behavior
- **Instruction Following**: Optimized for following human instructions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Efficient implementation for smaller models

## Model Architecture

- Based on SLM v03 architecture (25M parameters)
- Optimized for instruction following tasks
- Reward model with scalar output head
- PPO-compatible policy and value heads

## Training Pipeline

1. **SFT Phase**: Fine-tune on instruction-response pairs
2. **Reward Phase**: Train reward model on preference comparisons
3. **RLHF Phase**: PPO optimization using reward model feedback

## Key Innovations from InstructGPT

- Human preference learning over traditional metrics
- KL penalty to maintain coherent behavior
- Multi-step training process for alignment
- Robust evaluation on instruction-following tasks
