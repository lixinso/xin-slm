{"prompt": "How does photosynthesis work?", "chosen": "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. It occurs mainly in the leaves, where chlorophyll captures light energy. The process has two main stages: light-dependent reactions (which produce ATP and NADPH) and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) where CO2 is fixed into glucose. This process is essential for life on Earth as it produces oxygen and serves as the base of most food chains.", "rejected": "Plants use sunlight to make food and oxygen."}
